### Summary of Hybrid Cloud Architecture
**Hybrid cloud architecture** is the combination of public and [private clouds](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/private-cloud.html) by a wide area network or broadband connection, through which applications and data can be shared and which can be managed as a single IT architecture.




### Hybrid Cloud Architecture Details

#UseCase It is well suited to fluctuations in demand for computing resources since it enables businesses to scale from on-premises to public cloud-based to meet increased demand, and scale back from the [public cloud](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/public-cloud.html) to on-premises (private cloud) only once demand recedes.
