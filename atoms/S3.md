## Summary
S3 is an infinitely scaling object store. The backbone of AWS solutions.  99.999999999% durability - same across all storage classes. #awsservice 
## S3 Details
![](s3-storage-classes.png)
- [[S3 Security]] consists of User-Based, Resource-Based (Bucket policies etc) and encryption options.
- [[S3 Website]] permits hosting directly off of Buckets and [[CloudFront]] distributions
- S3 Versions protect agains unintended deletes by rolling back. Suspending versioning will not delete the previous version. Version ID `null` is a valid "version". Delete the `delete marker` to restore a deleted file.
- Deletes can be protected with [[MFA]]
- [#Replication]: Cross Region Replication (CRR) and Same Region Replication (SRR).
### Use Cases
- Storage: Hybrid Cloud Storage
- Disaster Recovery: Backup, Archive
- Hosting: Web Site, Media, Application
- Warehouse: Data Lakes, Big Data Analytics

### S3 Storage Classes
- Standard: 
	- 99.99% availability. Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures. #resilient 
	- Low Latency and high throughput.
	- Big data analytics, mobile , gaming applications, content distribution #usecase 
- IA (Infrequent Access):
	- 99.9% availability.
	- Cost on retrieval.
	- Disaster recovery, backups. #usecase 
- One-Zones
	- 99.5% availability. Data loss if AZ is destroyed.
	- Storing secondary backups or data that can be recreated. #usecase 
- Glacier 
	Low cost option for archival and backup. Cost for object retrieval.
	- Instant Retrieval
		- Millisecond retrieval, minimum storage duration 90 days.
		- Quarterly instantaneous retrieval. #usecase 
	- Flexible Retrieval
		- Expedited (1-5mins)
		- Standard (3-5hrs)
		- Bulk (5-12 hrs): Free
		- Minimum 90 days storage.
	- Deep Archive
		- Minimum 180 days, retrieval 12 hours
- Intelligent Tiering
Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee. Move objects automatically between tiers without charges for retrieval. #cost-optimized 
	- Automatic
		- Frequent Access Tier (default)
		- Infrequent Access Tier (moved after 30 days)
		- Archive Instant Access Tier (moved after 90 days)
	- Configurable
		- Archive Access Tier (90-700+ days)
		- Deep Archived Access Tier (180-700+ days)
### S3 Storage Lens
- Organization wide visibility into object-storage usage and activity. Includes recommendations to optimize, secure and improve performance.
### S3 Replication
- Replications are performed asynchronously. Existing Objects are not replicated - unless S3 Batch Replication is enabled.
- Delete operations are not replicated to prevent malicious deletes from replications. Optionally `delete markers` can be replicated.
- No chaining of replication i.e. Bucket 1 replicated to Bucket 2 which is replicated to Bucket 3 wont move objects from B1 to B3.
