### Summary of Encryption
Encrypt is a way of scrambling data so that only authorized parties understand it. #secure 


### Encryption Details
There are two types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric.
**Symmetric** 
> Shared key to encrypt and decrypt the data. e.g. session key between an authenticated server and browser
- 
**Asymmetric**
	Public key and private keys. Public key is used by the public to encrypt the data and is sent over an unsecured network. The server uses a secret private key
	The use of a private key to sign a message is a crucial component of many security protocols, such as SSL/TLS, S/MIME, and PGP, as well as digital certificates and other forms of digital identity verification.

> Cypher is the encryption algorithm.

> Client-Side Encryption
- Server can never decrypt. Server should never be able to decrypt.
