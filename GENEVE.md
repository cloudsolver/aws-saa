Geneve: Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8926
Network virtualization involved the cooperation of devices with a wide variety of capabilities such as software and hardware tunnel endpoints, transit fabrics, and centralized control clusters.

Networking has long featured a variety of tunneling, tagging, and other encapsulation mechanisms. However, the advent of network virtualization has caused a surge of renewed interest and a corresponding increase in the introduction of new protocols. The large number of protocols in this space -- for example, ranging all the way from VLANs [[IEEE.802.1Q_2018](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=8403925)] and MPLS [[RFC3031](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3031)] through the more recent VXLAN (Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network) [[RFC7348](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7348)] and NVGRE (Network Virtualization Using Generic Routing Encapsulation) [[RFC7637](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7637)] -- often leads to questions about the need for new encapsulation formats and what it is about network virtualization in particular that leads to their proliferation.
